Urban planner Jarrett Walker writes about the importance of transit **frequency**.

> First, you really must understand transit frequency.  It’s the elapsed time between consecutive buses (or trains, or ferries) on a line, which determines the maximum waiting time.  People who are used to getting around by a private vehicle (car or bike) often underestimate the importance of frequency, because there isn’t an equivalent to it in their experience.  A private vehicle is ready to go when you are, but transit is not going until it comes.  High frequency means transit is coming soon, which means that it approximates the feeling of liberty you have with your private vehicle – that you can go anytime.  Frequency is freedom!

The Transitland Datastore API brings together transit data from authoritative sources (listed in the [Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/)) with contributions, edits, and fixes from transit enthusiasts and developers.
